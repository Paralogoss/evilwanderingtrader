### Description

This minecraft mod adds a wandering trader that can become angry, targeting you, if you fail him (checking his sells but without making a deal) or if you hurt him.

![calm trader](assets/screen1.png)

If he becomes angry, he will hit you, stealing your items and his llamas will transform in their skeletal version, running away with your stolen items, stored in their chest.

Some people say he would eventually calm down, but only few have been smart enough to escape from his surveillance (or simply to survive the meeting).
